## Brand & Style

The brand personality is disciplined, intelligent, and encouraging. As a personal AI spending tracker, it aims to reduce financial anxiety through clarity and proactive insights. This design system leverages a **Minimalist Modern** aesthetic with heavy **Material Design 3 (MD3)** influence. 

The UI prioritizes a "calm tech" approach—using generous white space and a soft color palette to make complex financial data feel manageable. Visual weight is used sparingly to highlight AI-driven suggestions and urgent budget alerts. The experience should feel like a premium personal assistant: unobtrusive, precise, and sophisticated.

## Colors

The color strategy centers on the deep indigo primary, which evokes trust and professional stability. The background uses a slightly tinted off-white (#F8F7FF) to reduce screen glare and provide a softer canvas than pure white.

- **Primary:** Used for key actions, active states in the bottom navigation, and primary branding elements.
- **Success/Warning/Danger:** Employed strictly for financial status indicators (e.g., "Under Budget," "Approaching Limit," "Overspent").
- **Neutral/Text:** High-contrast indigo-tinted blacks are used for headings to maintain brand cohesion, while slate greys are used for secondary body text to establish clear hierarchy.

## Typography

The design system utilizes **Inter** for its exceptional readability on mobile displays and its neutral, systematic character. 

- **Numerical Data:** For currency (₹) and transaction amounts, use "Medium" or "SemiBold" weights to ensure financial figures are the focal point of the screen.
- **Hierarchy:** Use `display-lg` for total balance overviews and `label-md` (in all-caps) for category headers or timestamp markers.
- **Line Height:** Generous line heights are maintained to ensure the interface feels "airy" and legible even when displaying long lists of transactions.

## Layout & Spacing

This design system follows a **fluid-width mobile model** optimized for a 390px width. It uses an 8px base grid system to ensure consistent vertical rhythm.

- **Margins:** A standard 20px lateral margin is applied to the main viewport to prevent content from touching the screen edges.
- **Grid:** Use a 4-column layout for dashboard widgets and card layouts.
- **Padding:** Internal card padding is set to 16px (`stack-md`) to ensure content does not feel cramped within rounded containers.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth is communicated through **Soft Ambient Shadows** rather than harsh outlines. This creates a layered, "physical" feel reminiscent of stacked paper.

- **Level 0 (Background):** The off-white base layer.
- **Level 1 (Cards):** Surface color white with a very soft, diffused shadow (Y: 4px, Blur: 12px, Opacity: 4% Indigo tint).
- **Level 2 (Floating Action Button/Modals):** A more pronounced shadow to indicate interactivity and height (Y: 8px, Blur: 20px, Opacity: 8% Indigo tint).
- **Glassmorphism:** Bottom navigation bars should use a background blur (Backdrop Filter: 15px) with 90% opacity to allow content to peek through during scrolling.

## Shapes

The shape language is friendly and approachable. Following the "Rounded" setting, the system avoids sharp corners to maintain a soft, modern aesthetic.

- **Cards & Surfaces:** Use a 16px (1rem) corner radius.
- **Buttons:** Primary buttons and the FAB use a fully pill-shaped (32px+) radius to distinguish them from informational cards.
- **Input Fields:** Use an 8px (0.5rem) radius to feel sturdy and structured.

## Components

### Bottom Navigation
A fixed bar featuring 5 icons: Home, Analytics, [Center Action], Budget, and Profile. The active state uses the Primary Indigo for the icon and a small 4px dot indicator underneath.

### Floating Action Button (FAB)
The FAB is the primary entry point for "Add Expense." It is pill-shaped, colored in Primary Indigo, and positioned in the bottom-right or centered above the navigation bar. It should include a "+" icon and optionally the label "Add".

### Spending Cards
Cards are the primary container for data. They feature no borders, a white background, and soft shadows. Headers within cards should use `title-lg`.

### Transaction Lists
Transactions are grouped by date. Each row includes a category icon (rounded circle with 10% primary tint), a title, and the currency amount in `INR (₹)`. Negative amounts use the default text color, while "income" or "refunds" use the Success Green.

### Input Fields
Forms should use "Outlined" styles but with very low-contrast borders (1px, Slate 200). On focus, the border transitions to a 2px Primary Indigo stroke.

### Progress Bars
Used for budget tracking. The track is a light grey-indigo, while the indicator uses Success, Warning, or Danger colors based on the percentage of budget consumed.
